# Garritan-CFX-settings

Settings I am using for Garritan Abbey Road Studios CFX VST: [download](https://github.com/mrowan137/Garritan-CFX-settings/raw/main/Garritan_CFX_settings.aria).

Currently I am following settings described in [this tutorial](https://www.pianistkeunyoungsong.com/2022/04/how-to-make-garritan-cfx-sounds-better.html), with volume faders set to 0dB.

If you're looking into Garritan CFX configurations and also a user of GarageBand, then it's possible you may be interested in converting AIFF audio to MIDI format. There is a very useful tool [GB2MIDI](https://github.com/larkob/GB2MIDI) that allows to do that conversion, which you can do [here](https://larkob.github.io/GB2MIDI/index.html).
